<h2>AWS Global Infrastructure </h2>


<summary><b>Explain the following</b></summary><br>
<b>Answer :</b><br>
  <b>* Availability zone -</b>AWS regions are data centers hosted across different geographical locations worldwide, each region is completely independent of one another.<br>
  <b>* Region -</b>           Within each region, there are multiple isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Multiple availability zones ensure high availability in case one of them goes down.<br>
 <b> * Edge location -</b>    Edge locations are basically content delivery network which caches data and insures lower latency and faster delivery to the users in any location. They are located in major cities in the world.<br>

</b>

<h2>AWS Networking</h2>


<summary><b>What is VPC?</b></summary><br>
<b>Answer :</b>
A logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.<br>
</b>


  <summary><b>What are the components of Amazon VPC ?</b><br></summary>
  <b>Answer :</b><br>

<b>Amazon VPC comprises a variety of objects that will be familiar to customers with existing networks:</b><br>
<b>*A Virtual Private Cloud:</b> A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud. You define a VPC’s IP address space from ranges you select.<br>
<b>*Subnet: </b>A segment of a VPC’s IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.<br>
<b>*Internet Gateway:</b> The Amazon VPC side of a connection to the public Internet.<br>
<b>*NAT Gateway: </b>A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for your resources in a private subnet to access the Internet.<br>
<b>*Virtual private gateway: </b> The Amazon VPC side of a VPN connection.<br>
<b>*Peering Connection:</b> A peering connection enables you to route traffic via private IP addresses between two peered VPCs.<br>
<b>*VPC Endpoints: </b> Enables private connectivity to services hosted in AWS, from within your VPC without using an Internet Gateway, VPN, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, or firewall proxies.<br>
<b>*Egress-only Internet Gateway: </b> A stateful gateway to provide egress only access for IPv6 traffic from the VPC to the Internet.<br>




<summary><b> VPC spans multiple regions ? (True or False)</b></summary><br>
<b>Answer :</b> False
</b>


<summary><b>Subnets belong to the same VPC, can be in different availability zones ? (True or False)</b></summary><br>
<b>Answer :</b>
<b>True</b><br>Just to clarify, a subnet must reside entirely in one AZ.
</b>



<summary><b>What is an Internet Gateway ?</b></summary><br>
<b>Answer :</b><br>
An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. <br>
Its  enables resources (like EC2 instances) in your public subnets to connect to the internet if the resource has a public IPv4 or an IPv6 address. <br>
Similarly, resources on the internet can initiate a connection to resources in your subnet using the public IPv4  or IPv6 address. <br>
An internet gateway enables you to connect to an EC2 instance in AWS using your local computer.<br>
</b>



  <summary><b>What are the differences between security groups in a VPC and network ACLs in a VPC ?</summary></b><br>

<b>Answer</b><br>
     -Security groups in a VPC specify which traffic is allowed to or from an Amazon EC2 instance.<br>
     -Network ACLs operate at the subnet level and evaluate traffic entering and exiting a subnet. <br>
     -Network ACLs can be used to set both Allow and Deny rules. <br>
     -Network ACLs do not filter traffic between instances in the same subnet.<br> 
     -In addition, network ACLs perform stateless filtering while security groups perform stateful filtering.<br>






<summary> <b>NACL allow or deny traffic on the subnet level ? (True or False)</b> </summary><br>

<b>Answer :</b> 
True



<summary><b> Multiple Internet Gateways can be attached to one VPC ? (True or False)</b></summary><br>

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. <br>
EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances. <br>
EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance.<br>
Provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices.<br>

<b>Features of Amazon EBS</b><br>
You create an EBS volume in a specific Availability Zone, and then attach it to an instance in that same Availability Zone. <br>
To make a volume available outside of the Availability Zone, you can create a snapshot and restore that snapshot to a new volume anywhere in that Region. <br>
You can copy snapshots to other Regions and then restore them to new volumes there, making it easier to leverage multiple AWS Regions for geographical expansion, data center migration, and disaster recovery.<br>
